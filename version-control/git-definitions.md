# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control is a system that allows you to branch out a project so muliple people can work on it or you can work on parts of it seperately and then merge then back together.  You are able to view a history of the revisions also. It is useful because more then one person can work on a project and the project will stay organized.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch creates a file that is a duplicate of your master branch, so that you or other people can make modifications to your project and then merge them back into the master.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is a save point in Git. It also communicates what you have done on a project. A good commit message is a concise explanation of what you have done.

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict is when two branches have changed the same part of the same file and then try to merge back together.  Git does not know which one to use.
