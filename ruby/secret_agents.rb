        #Pseudocode - encrypt

Go through the password one letter at a time,
take the next letter in the alphabet from that letter,
and put the new letter in the corresponding spot
in a new "encrypted password" variable.
Repeat this process starting with 0
and going up to the length of the password

If a character in the password is a space,
just copy the space over to the corresponding spot
in the encrypted password

If a character in the password is the letter z,
the next letter would be "aa",
so instead just make that spot in the encrypted password
a letter "a".

def encrypt(password)
  encrypted_password = ""
  index = 0
  while index < password.length
    if (password[index] != " ") && (password[index] != "z")
      encrypted_password[index] = password[index].next
    elsif password[index] == " "
      encrypted_password[index] = password[index]
    elsif password[index] == "z"
      encrypted_password[index] = "a"
    end
    index += 1
  end


  puts "the encrypted password is: "
  p encrypted_password
end

=begin
 take one letter of the encrypted password
 find out where in the alphabet that is
 and make that spot in the decrypted password
 equal to one spot earlier in the alphabet.

if a character in the encrypted password is a space,
just copy that space over to decrypted password.



encrypted_password[index]
decrypted_password[index] = alphabet[alphabet.index(encrypted_password[index]) - 1]

When the letter in the encrypted password is "a",
the index in the alphabet of "a" is "0",
so when we subtract 1 to go to one spot earlier in the alphabet,
the index in the alphabet becomes "-1",
which then tells the program to use the last letter
in the alphabet string variable, which is "z".

      decrypted_password[index] = encrypted_password[index]
   end
