### Git Concepts

_The Git concepts I have been struggling with prior to the GPS session:_

* When to git fetch vs. git pull
* When to git push vs. git merge
* How often should we push and merge
* When do you use git init

_Concepts that were clarified_

> git pull - fetches from and intergrates with another repository or local branch.

> git fetch - downloads objects and refs from another repository.

_Questions asked pair and guide_

* What is git fetch and how is it different from git pull?
* What is an mit license?

What still confuses me about git is the workflow. I need to keep practicing.

My first experience of pairing in GPS was really good.  It was nice to work with someone and talk through what we were doing.  It was a good learning experience.  It was also nice to have someone right there to ask questions if needed.
