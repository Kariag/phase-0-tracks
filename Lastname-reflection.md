### Git Concepts

_The Git concepts I have been struggling with prior to the GPS session:_

* When to git fetch vs. git pull
* When to git push vs. git merge
* How often should we push and merge
* When do you use git init

_Concepts that were clarified_

> git pull - fetches from and intergrates with another repository or local branch.

> git fetch - downloads objects and refs from another repository.
